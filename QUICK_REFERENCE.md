## Token Allocation Breakdown

When you create a dataset token:

| Recipient | Amount | Percentage |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Bonding Curve | 900,000 | 90% |
| Creator | 50,000 | 5% |
| Platform | 50,000 | 5% |
| **Total** | **1,000,000** | **100%** |

**Allocation Times**:
- Creator gets 50k tokens immediately
- Platform gets 50k tokens immediately  
- Curve gets 900k tokens + 0.005 ETH immediately

---

## Bonding Curve Math

### Price Formula
```
Price per token = Total ETH in Curve / Total Tokens in Curve
```

### Example: First Buy

**Initial State**:
- ETH in Curve: 0.005
- Tokens in Curve: 900,000
- Price: 0.005 / 900,000 = 0.0000055 ETH/token

**User buys 0.001 ETH**:
- New ETH: 0.006
- Approx tokens: ~181
- New Price: 0.006 / (900,000 + 181) â‰ˆ 0.0000066 ETH/token
- **Price increased!** â†‘

**User sells 100 tokens**:
- ETH received: ~0.00065
- New ETH: 0.00535
- New Price: 0.00535 / 899,900 â‰ˆ 0.0000059 ETH/token
- **Price decreased!** â†“

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| "Port 4000 in use" | `lsof -i :4000` then `kill -9 <PID>` |
| "Module not found" | `npm install` again |
| "MetaMask not working" | Add Base Sepolia to MetaMask manually |
| "No testnet ETH" | https://www.basefaucet.io/ |
| "Factory not deployed" | Run `npm run deploy` |
| "Listener not running" | Make sure Terminal 2 is running `npm run listen` |
| "API not responding" | Check Terminal 1 is running `npm run dev` |
| "Buy/Sell errors" | Check you're on Base Sepolia + have ETH |

---

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | Your credentials |
| `contracts/BondingCurve.sol` | AMM contract |
| `contracts/DataCoin.sol` | Token contract |
| `contracts/DataCoinFactory.sol` | Factory contract |
| `frontend/app.js` | UI logic |
| `backend/server.js` | API endpoints |
| `backend/listener.js` | Event monitor |
| `backend/datasets.json` | Token registry |
| `backend/db.json` | Access logs |

## Common Workflows

### Create 3 Datasets
```bash
npm run create "Medical Data" "MEDDATA"
npm run create "Climate Data" "CLIMATE"
npm run create "E-commerce Data" "ECOM"
```

### Monitor Event Listener
```bash
# Terminal 2, watch for "ðŸ”¥ Granting access" messages
npm run listen
```

### Check Token on Basescan
```
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xDEF456...
```

### Test API
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/datasets
curl http://localhost:4000/price/0xGHI789...
curl http://localhost:4000/quote/buy/0xGHI789.../0.001
```

---

## Terminal Setup

You need **2 terminals**:

**Terminal 1** (API):
```bash
npm run dev
# Output: ðŸš€ Backend API running on port 4000
# Keep running while using the app
```

**Terminal 2** (Listener):
```bash
npm run listen
# Output: Listener running (HTTP polling)
# Keep running to detect burns
```

**Terminal 3** (if needed for more commands):
```bash
# Use for npm run create, etc.
# Commands run and complete
```

---

## Key Addresses to Save

After deployment:

| Item | Address | Where |
|------|---------|-------|
| Factory | `0x...` | From `npm run deploy` |
| Token 1 | `0x...` | From `npm run create` |
| Curve 1 | `0x...` | From `npm run create` |
| Your Account | `0x342F483f...` | In MetaMask |
| Platform | `0x342F483f...` | In .env |

## Performance Notes

| Operation | Time | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Deploy Factory | 30s | ~0.01 ETH |
| Create Token | 30s | ~0.01 ETH |
| Buy Tokens | 15-30s | ~0.001 ETH |
| Sell Tokens | 15-30s | ~0.001 ETH |
| Burn Tokens | 15-30s | ~0.001 ETH |
| Get Price | <1s | $0 |
| List Datasets | <1s | $0 |

**Total Setup Cost**: ~0.05 ETH per dataset

## Pro Tips

1. **Save your factory address** - you'll need it for creating tokens
2. **Keep listener running** - without it, burns won't be detected
3. **Monitor gas prices** - limit orders are cheap, so batch them
4. **Test thoroughly** - try all features before alpha testing
5. **Check Basescan** - verify all transactions and addresses
6. **Watch listener logs** - they show what's happening behind the scenes
7. **Use testnet first** - never use mainnet credentials in testing
