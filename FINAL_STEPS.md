# 🎯 FINAL STEPS - Get Your System Running

You now have a complete MYRAD DataCoin platform implemented. Here's exactly what to do next.

## ✅ What's Ready

- ✅ BondingCurve.sol (AMM contract)
- ✅ Updated DataCoinFactory (deploys curves)
- ✅ Updated DataCoin (token contract)
- ✅ Backend API with pricing endpoints
- ✅ Frontend with bonding curve trading
- ✅ Event listener for burn → download access
- ✅ Complete documentation

## 🚀 Next 10 Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for all packages to install. This includes:
- Hardhat (smart contract tools)
- Ethers.js (blockchain interaction)
- Express (backend server)
- OpenZeppelin (secure contracts)

**Expected Time**: 2-5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Verify Environment Setup

Check `.env` file has your credentials:

```bash
cat .env
```

You should see:
```env
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
PRIVATE_KEY=03031b4a3e28790d8c67fa17e199360b72bcdbc8b1861c19da505de1be2fd77c
MYRAD_TREASURY=0x342F483f1dDfcdE701e7dB281C6e56aC4C7b05c9
DOWNLOAD_SECRET=myrad-secret-key-change-in-production
PORT=4000
```

✅ **Confirm all values are present**

---

### Step 3: Deploy Factory Contract

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**This will**:
1. Compile smart contracts
2. Deploy DataCoinFactory to Base Sepolia
3. Save factory address to `.env.local`
4. Output deployment details

**Expected Output**:
```
Deployer: 0x342F483f1dDfcdE701e7dB281C6e56aC4C7b05c9
Platform Treasury: 0x342F483f1dDfcdE701e7dB281C6e56aC4C7b05c9

🚀 Deploying DataCoinFactory...
✅ DataCoinFactory deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
📡 Network: Base Sepolia (chainId: 84532)
🔗 Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

💾 Factory address saved to .env.local
```

**✅ Save the factory address**: You'll see it in output.

**Expected Time**: 30-60 seconds

---

### Step 4: Create First Dataset Token

```bash
npm run create "Medical Records Dataset" "MEDDATA"
```

**This will**:
1. Create a new DataCoin token
2. Deploy a bonding curve for it
3. Mint token allocations:
   - 900,000 tokens → Bonding curve (90%)
   - 50,000 tokens → Creator wallet (5%)
   - 50,000 tokens → Platform treasury (5%)
4. Send ~$5 ETH to the bonding curve
5. Update backend dataset registry

**Expected Output**:
```
🔧 Configuration:
   Deployer: 0x342F...
   Platform: 0x342F...
   Token: Medical Records Dataset (MEDDATA)
   CID: bafkreifpymts2rinunnptk6pejo3znkuag7yevcty2qmuhuu7jmglmyo34
   Initial Liquidity: 0.005 ETH

🚀 Step 1: Creating token via factory
   ✅ Tx confirmed: 0xabc123...
   ✅ DataCoin deployed at: 0xDEF456...
   ✅ BondingCurve deployed at: 0xGHI789...

💰 Step 2: Minting token allocations
   ✅ Creator allocation: 50000.0 tokens
   ✅ Platform allocation: 50000.0 tokens
   ✅ Bonding curve allocation: 900000.0 tokens

💧 Step 3: Initializing bonding curve with ETH liquidity
   ✅ Sent 0.005 ETH to bonding curve

📊 Bonding Curve State:
   ETH Balance: 0.005 ETH
   Token Supply: 900000.0 tokens
   Price per token: 0.0000055 ETH

📁 Step 4: Updating backend datasets
   ✅ Updated backend/datasets.json

🎉 Success! Token created and ready to trade
```

**Note these addresses**:
- Token: 0xDEF456...
- Bonding Curve: 0xGHI789...

**Expected Time**: 30-60 seconds

**✅ Verify on Basescan**:
Go to: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xDEF456
You should see your token with balances.

---

### Step 5: Start API Server

**Open Terminal 1**, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🚀 Backend API running on port 4000
📊 Open http://localhost:4000
```

**Keep this running** - this is your backend.

**Expected Time**: 2 seconds

---

### Step 6: Start Event Listener

**Open Terminal 2** (new terminal window), run:

```bash
npm run listen
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Using JsonRpcProvider (HTTP) for RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
Starting polling from block: 12345678
Listener running (HTTP polling). Poll interval: 8000 ms
```

**Keep this running** - this monitors blockchain events.

**Expected Time**: 2 seconds

**ℹ️ You now have TWO terminal windows running**:
- Terminal 1: `npm run dev` (API server)
- Terminal 2: `npm run listen` (Event listener)

---

### Step 7: Open Frontend in Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:4000**

You should see:
- "MYRAD DataCoin MVP" title
- "Connect Wallet" button
- Your dataset listed with symbol "MEDDATA"
- Price displayed (e.g., "price: 0.0000055 ETH")
- Buy/Sell input fields
- Burn button

**✅ If you see all this, frontend is working!**

**Expected Time**: 1 second

---

### Step 8: Connect Your Wallet

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** button
2. MetaMask popup appears
3. **Verify Base Sepolia is selected**:
   - Should say "Base Sepolia" in MetaMask
   - If not, switch to it first
4. Click **"Connect"**

**Expected Result**:
- Address appears (e.g., "0x342F...")
- "Wallet connected: 0x..." message
- "Connect Wallet" button disappears

**❌ If it fails**:
- Install MetaMask: https://metamask.io/
- Add Base Sepolia network to MetaMask
- Switch to Base Sepolia testnet
- Try again

**Expected Time**: 5 seconds

---

### Step 9: Test Token Purchase

**Prerequisite**: You need ~0.1 ETH testnet balance

If you don't have testnet ETH:
1. Go to: https://www.basefaucet.io/
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet ETH
4. Wait ~1 minute
5. Refresh this page

**Once you have ETH**:

1. Scroll to MEDDATA dataset
2. Enter **0.001** in "ETH to spend" field
3. Click **"Buy"** button
4. Confirmation popup appears
5. Shows: "Buy ~X tokens for 0.001 ETH?"
6. Click **"Confirm"** in popup
7. MetaMask appears
8. Click **"Confirm"** in MetaMask
9. Wait for transaction (10-30 seconds)

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ Buy confirmed! Received ~181 tokens
```

In the UI:
- Your balance should increase
- Price should increase slightly
- Can refresh to see updated price

**Expected Time**: 20-40 seconds

---

### Step 10: Test Complete Workflow

Now test the full workflow:

#### 10A: Sell Tokens

1. Enter **100** in "Token amt" field
2. Click **"Sell"** button
3. Approve transaction (if first time)
4. Confirm in MetaMask
5. Wait for transaction

**Expected**:
```
✅ Sell confirmed! Received ~0.0007 ETH
```

#### 10B: Burn for Download

1. **Buy tokens again** (0.001 ETH)
2. Click **"🔥 Burn for Download"** button
3. Confirm in MetaMask
4. Wait for transaction

**Expected**:
```
🔥 Sending burn transaction...
✅ Burned! Waiting for backend access...
✅ Download opened!
```

A download link should open automatically!

#### 10C: Check Terminal 2 Listener

In Terminal 2, you should see:
```
🔥 Granting access: {
  "user": "0x342f...",
  "symbol": "MEDDATA",
  "token": "0xdef456...",
  "amount": "1000000000000000000",
  "downloadUrl": "https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/...",
  "ts": 1697234567890
}
```

This confirms the listener detected the burn! ✅

**Expected Time**: 30-60 seconds total
