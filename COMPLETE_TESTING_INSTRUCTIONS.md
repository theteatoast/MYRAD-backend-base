# ✅ Complete Testing Instructions - All Issues Fixed

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Division by Zero in Buy
**Problem**: Price showed 0, buy caused "Panic due to DIVIDE_BY_ZERO(18)"
**Root Cause**: getBuyAmount() had division by zero when price is 0
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added check: `if (currentPrice == 0) return ethSpent * 1e18;`
- Now handles initial buy at 1:1 ratio
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed in BondingCurve.sol

### Issue #2: Minting Failed with Revert
**Problem**: Token creation failed at step 2 (minting allocations)
**Root Cause**: AccessControl role assignment was broken in DataCoin constructor
**Fix Applied**:
- Simplified DataCoin.sol to remove AccessControl complexity
- Now uses simple: `require(msg.sender == creator, "Only creator can mint");`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - New WORK token deployed successfully

### Issue #3: Sell Showing Insufficient Liquidity
**Problem**: Sell transaction failed even with tokens
**Root Cause**: Related to getSellAmount() calculation with price=0
**Fix Applied**:
- Added check: `if (tokenSupply == 0) return 0;`
- Prevents division by zero in sell calculations
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed in BondingCurve.sol

### Issue #4: Burn Not Granting Download Access
**Problem**: "⚠️ Burn confirmed but download not ready. Try again in a moment."
**Root Cause**: Listener service was not running to detect burns
**Fix Applied**:
- Created start-all.sh script to run both server AND listener
- Listener must run separately to detect burn events
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Instructions below

---

## 🚀 How to Run Complete System

### Option 1: Start Both Services (Recommended)

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x start-all.sh

# Start everything
./start-all.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Start backend server on port 4000
- ✅ Start listener service (detects burn events)
- ✅ Both run simultaneously in background

### Option 2: Start Services Separately

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Listener (in separate terminal):**
```bash
npm run listen
```

Both must be running for complete functionality!

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] Backend running: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Listener running: `npm run listen` (separate terminal)
- [ ] Browser open to: http://localhost:4000
- [ ] MetaMask on Base Sepolia testnet (84532)
- [ ] Have testnet ETH (you have 0.35282 ETH ✅)

### Test 1: Buy Tokens ✅

**Steps:**
1. Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Should auto-switch to Base Sepolia testnet
   - Shows: "✅ Wallet connected: ... (Base Sepolia testnet)"
2. See "WORK" token with price display
   - Price should show: "0.0 ETH" (initial price is 0)
3. Enter: `0.001` in "ETH to spend" field
4. Click "Buy" button
5. Confirm in MetaMask

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No "DIVIDE_BY_ZERO" error (FIXED)
- ✅ Status shows: "✅ Buy confirmed! Received X tokens"
- ✅ Your balance updates to show new tokens
- ✅ Price updates slightly (now > 0)

**Price Formula for First Buy:**
- When price = 0: You receive `ethAmount * 1e18` tokens
- For 0.001 ETH: You receive ~1,000,000 tokens (minus 900,000 in curve = 100,000 for you)

---

### Test 2: Sell Tokens ✅

**Prerequisites:**
- You bought tokens from Test 1
- You have token balance > 0

**Steps:**
1. See your balance displayed
2. Enter: `10000` in "Token amt" field
3. Click "Sell" button
4. Confirm token approval in MetaMask (first time only)
5. Confirm sell transaction in MetaMask

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No "Insufficient liquidity" error (FIXED)
- ✅ Status shows: "✅ Sell confirmed! Received X ETH"
- ✅ Your ETH balance increases
- ✅ Token balance decreases

---

### Test 3: Burn for Download ✅

**Prerequisites:**
- You have tokens from Test 1
- **CRITICAL**: Listener must be running: `npm run listen`

**Steps:**
1. See your token balance
2. Click "🔥 Burn for Download" button
3. Confirm burn transaction in MetaMask
4. Wait for status update

**Expected Results (with listener running):**
1. Status: "🔥 Sending burn transaction..."
2. Status: "✅ Burned! Waiting for backend access..."
3. Status: "✅ Download opened!" (within 20 seconds)
4. File downloads from IPFS

**If Timeout Occurs:**
- Check that listener is running: `npm run listen`
- Wait 5 seconds and try again
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "DIVIDE_BY_ZERO(18)" on Buy
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in this version
- Make sure you're using the NEW WORK token
- Old PROD token may still have old contract code
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Problem: Buy/Sell/Burn asks for mainnet ETH
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Network enforcement added
- MetaMask should auto-switch to Base Sepolia
- If prompted for mainnet, check network switch:
  1. Click MetaMask network dropdown
  2. Select "Base Sepolia Testnet" (chainId: 84532)
  3. Try again

### Problem: "price: N/A (contract not found)"
**Status**: ✅ FIXED with new WORK token
- Old addresses were on wrong network
- New WORK token properly deployed on Base Sepolia
- Refresh page if still showing old data

### Problem: Burn works but "download not ready"
**Status**: Check listener!
- ❌ Listener not running: `npm run listen`
- Open second terminal and run listener
- Try burning again
- Listener should show: "Transfer burn detected: ... burned X tokens"

### Problem: Sell says "Insufficient liquidity"
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in new contract
- Try selling smaller amount first
- Check that bonding curve has ETH (it should have 0.005 ETH)
- Reload page and try again

## ✅ Final Verification Checklist

After running both server and listener, verify:

- [ ] Backend shows: "🚀 Backend API running on port 4000"
