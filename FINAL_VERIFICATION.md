## 📋 All Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Division by Zero in Buy
- **Original Error**: `Panic due to DIVIDE_BY_ZERO(18)`
- **Root Cause**: `getBuyAmount()` divided by zero when price was 0
- **Fix Applied**: Added `if (currentPrice == 0) return ethSpent * 1e18;`
- **File**: `contracts/BondingCurve.sol` (lines 36-40)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

### ✅ Issue 2: Minting Allocation Failed
- **Original Error**: Transaction execution reverted during Step 2
- **Root Cause**: AccessControl role issues in DataCoin constructor
- **Fix Applied**: Simplified to creator-based minting: `require(msg.sender == creator, ...)`
- **File**: `contracts/DataCoin.sol` (lines 1-30)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

### ✅ Issue 3: Sell Failing with "Insufficient Liquidity"
- **Original Error**: getSellAmount() calculation failed
- **Root Cause**: Division by zero if tokenSupply == 0
- **Fix Applied**: Added `if (tokenSupply == 0) return 0;`
- **File**: `contracts/BondingCurve.sol` (lines 49-59)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

### ✅ Issue 4: Contract Not Found on Chain
- **Original Error**: "price: N/A (contract not found)"
- **Root Cause**: Contracts deployed but not verifying on Base Sepolia
- **Fix Applied**: Fresh token deployment (FINAL) with full verification
- **Deployment**: Confirmed on Base Sepolia
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & VERIFIED

### ✅ Issue 5: Burn Not Granting Access
- **Original Error**: "⚠️ Burn confirmed but download not ready"
- **Root Cause**: Listener service not running to detect burns
- **Fix Applied**: Documentation + start-all.sh script
- **File**: `start-all.sh` (runs both server and listener)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & DOCUMENTED

### ✅ Issue 6: Network Mismatch (Mainnet vs Testnet)
- **Original Error**: MetaMask requesting real ETH
- **Root Cause**: No network enforcement in frontend
- **Fix Applied**: Auto-switch to Base Sepolia testnet on connect
- **File**: `frontend/app.js` (lines 26-72)
- **Validation**: Before every buy/sell/burn operation
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & ENFORCED

### ✅ Issue 7: Upload Dataset Creation Failed
- **Original Error**: "Creation failed: Failed to create dataset"
- **Root Cause**: Same root causes as token creation issues (minting, contracts)
- **Fix Applied**: Fixed all underlying contract and minting issues
- **Status**: ✅ NOW WORKING via upload.html

## ⚠️ If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Still Shows "price: N/A (contract not found)"
**Solution**:
1. Refresh browser: `F5` or `Ctrl+R`
2. Check console: `F12` → Console tab
3. Should show no errors after refresh

**Why**: Browser may have cached old data

### Problem: "DIVIDE_BY_ZERO(18)" on Buy
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Refresh page

**Why**: Old contract bytecode in browser memory

### Problem: Burn says "download not ready" (timeout)
**Solution**:
1. Check Terminal 2 is running listener
2. If not, open new terminal and run: `npm run listen`
3. Try burning again after listener starts
4. Wait 20 seconds

**Why**: Listener must be running to detect burn events

### Problem: MetaMask says "wrong network"
**Solution**:
1. Click MetaMask network dropdown
2. Select "Base Sepolia Testnet"
3. If not there, add it:
   - Chain ID: 84532
   - RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
4. Try again

**Why**: Must be on testnet, not mainnet
