# ‚úÖ MYRAD DataCoin - Deployment Checklist

Complete this checklist to successfully deploy and test your platform.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Base Sepolia testnet ETH in wallet (~0.1 ETH)
- [ ] MetaMask installed and configured for Base Sepolia
- [ ] `.env` file with credentials
- [ ] Dependencies installed with `npm install`
- [ ] Hardhat properly configured in `hardhat.config.js`

## Step 1: Deploy Factory Contract

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deployer: 0x...
Platform Treasury: 0x342F483f1dDfcdE701e7dB281C6e56aC4C7b05c9
üöÄ Deploying DataCoinFactory...
‚úÖ DataCoinFactory deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors in deployment
- [ ] Factory address in output
- [ ] `.env.local` file created
- [ ] Address starts with `0x`
- [ ] Basescan shows contract code at address

## Step 2: Save Factory Address

1. Copy the factory address from deployment output
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef...
   ```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] `FACTORY_ADDRESS` added to `.env`
- [ ] Correct format (0x followed by 40 hex chars)
- [ ] No extra spaces or quotes

## Step 3: Create First Dataset Token

```bash
npm run create "Medical Records Dataset" "MEDDATA"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîß Configuration:
   Deployer: 0x...
   Platform: 0x342F483f1dDfcdE701e7dB281C6e56aC4C7b05c9
   Token: Medical Records Dataset (MEDDATA)
   
‚úÖ DataCoin deployed at: 0xDEF456...
‚úÖ BondingCurve deployed at: 0xGHI789...

üí∞ Step 2: Minting token allocations
   ‚úÖ Creator allocation: 50000.0 tokens
   ‚úÖ Platform allocation: 50000.0 tokens
   ‚úÖ Bonding curve allocation: 900000.0 tokens

üíß Step 3: Initializing bonding curve with ETH liquidity
   ‚úÖ Sent 0.005 ETH to bonding curve

üìä Bonding Curve State:
   ETH Balance: 0.005 ETH
   Token Supply: 900000.0 tokens
   Price per token: 0.0000055 ETH
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors during creation
- [ ] Token and bonding curve addresses in output
- [ ] Creator allocation: 50000 tokens
- [ ] Platform allocation: 50000 tokens
- [ ] Curve allocation: 900000 tokens
- [ ] ETH Balance: 0.005 ETH
- [ ] Price calculated correctly
- [ ] `backend/datasets.json` updated

## Step 4: Verify Contracts on Basescan

For each contract address from Step 3:

1. Go to https://sepolia.basescan.org/
2. Paste token address in search
3. Verify you see:
   - Token symbol (e.g., "MEDDATA")
   - Holders list
   - Transfer history
   - Token tracker

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Token contract visible on Basescan
- [ ] Correct symbol and name
- [ ] Bonding curve shows as holder with 900k tokens
- [ ] Creator shows as holder with 50k tokens
- [ ] Platform shows as holder with 50k tokens

## Step 5: Start Backend Services

**Terminal 1 - API Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected: 
```
üöÄ Backend API running on port 4000
üìä Open http://localhost:4000
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors in startup
- [ ] Port 4000 listening
- [ ] "Backend API running" message

**Terminal 2 - Event Listener:**
```bash
npm run listen
```

Expected:
```
Using JsonRpcProvider (HTTP) for RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
Starting polling from block: 12345678
Listener running (HTTP polling). Poll interval: 8000 ms
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors in startup
- [ ] Polling interval set correctly
- [ ] "Listener running" message
- [ ] Both services running simultaneously

## Step 6: Test Frontend

1. Open http://localhost:4000 in browser
2. You should see:
   - "MYRAD DataCoin MVP" title
   - "Connect Wallet" button
   - Your dataset listed (with MEDDATA symbol)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All UI elements visible
- [ ] Dataset shows correct symbol
- [ ] Price displays (e.g., "price: 0.0000055 ETH")

## Step 7: Connect Wallet

1. Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. MetaMask should popup
3. Verify you're on "Base Sepolia" network
4. Click "Connect"
5. Address should appear (e.g., "0x342F...")

**Checklist:**
- [ ] MetaMask popup appears
- [ ] Correct network selected
- [ ] Address displays after connection
- [ ] "Wallet connected" message shown
- [ ] "Connect Wallet" button hidden

## Step 8: Test Token Purchase

1. Ensure you have testnet ETH (if not, get from faucet)
2. Enter `0.001` in "ETH to spend" input
3. Click "Buy" button
4. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for confirmation

**Expected:**
```
‚è≥ Confirm buy in wallet...
‚úÖ Buy confirmed! Received ~X tokens
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No errors in buy process
- [ ] MetaMask confirmation requested
- [ ] Transaction confirmed on blockchain
- [ ] Balance increased
- [ ] Price in UI updated

## Step 9: Test Token Sale

1. Ensure you have tokens from Step 8
2. Enter `100` in "Token amt" input
3. Click "Sell" button
4. Approve if prompted
5. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
6. Wait for confirmation

**Expected:**
```
‚è≥ Approving token for swap...
‚úÖ Approved, now selling...
‚úÖ Sell confirmed! Received ~X ETH
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Approval transaction (if needed)
- [ ] Sell confirmation requested
- [ ] Transaction confirmed
- [ ] ETH balance increased in wallet
- [ ] Token balance decreased
- [ ] Price updated higher (since less tokens sold)

## Step 10: Test Burn for Download

1. Buy some more tokens (0.001 ETH)
2. Click "üî• Burn for Download" button
3. Wait for blockchain confirmation
4. Listen should detect the burn

**Expected:**
```
üî• Sending burn transaction...
‚úÖ Burned! Waiting for backend access...
‚úÖ Download opened!
```

**Expected in Listener logs:**
```
üî• Granting access: {
  "user": "0x...",
  "symbol": "MEDDATA",
  "downloadUrl": "https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/...",
  "ts": ...
}
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Burn transaction confirmed
- [ ] Listener detects burn in logs
- [ ] IPFS download link generated
- [ ] Download opens in new tab
- [ ] File accessible from IPFS

## Post-Deployment Verification

### API Endpoints

Test these endpoints in browser:

```
GET /datasets
http://localhost:4000/datasets

GET /price
http://localhost:4000/price/0xGHI789...

GET /quote/buy
http://localhost:4000/quote/buy/0xGHI789.../0.001

GET /quote/sell
http://localhost:4000/quote/sell/0xGHI789.../1000

GET /access
http://localhost:4000/access/0x342F.../MEDDATA
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All endpoints respond without errors
- [ ] Data format is correct JSON
- [ ] Price quotes are reasonable
- [ ] Access endpoint returns download link after burn

### Data Files

Check these files were created/updated:

**`backend/datasets.json`**
```json
{
  "0xtoken1": {
    "symbol": "MEDDATA",
    "cid": "bafkreif...",
    "bonding_curve": "0xcurve1",
    "creator": "0xcreator1",
    "timestamp": 1697234567890
  }
}
```

**`backend/db.json`**
Should contain access entries after burns.

**`backend/lastBlock.json`**
Should contain latest processed block number.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] `datasets.json` contains your token
- [ ] `db.json` has access logs after burns
- [ ] `lastBlock.json` updates after listener runs

## Troubleshooting During Deployment

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "FACTORY_ADDRESS not set" | Deploy factory first, add address to `.env` |
| "Connection refused" | Verify RPC URL is correct and accessible |
| "Insufficient gas" | Get more testnet ETH from faucet |
| "Token not in datasets.json" | Token creation failed, check logs |
| "Listener not working" | Make sure both server AND listener running |
| "Can't connect wallet" | Add Base Sepolia to MetaMask |
| "Buy/Sell buttons unresponsive" | Check you're on correct network and have ETH |

## Success Criteria

You know deployment is successful when:

‚úÖ Factory deployed to Base Sepolia
‚úÖ Token created with bonding curve
‚úÖ Frontend displays dataset
‚úÖ Wallet connects properly
‚úÖ Can buy tokens (price increases)
‚úÖ Can sell tokens (price decreases)
‚úÖ Can burn tokens for download
‚úÖ Download link works
‚úÖ All API endpoints functional
‚úÖ Data files created properly

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Create more datasets**: `npm run create "Name" "SYMBOL"`
2. **Monitor on Basescan**: Track transactions and balances
3. **Test thoroughly**: Try edge cases, stress test
4. **Add features**:
   - File upload (replace hardcoded CID)
   - Creator dashboard
   - Analytics/charts
5. **Prepare for mainnet**: When ready to go live

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security**
- These are testnet credentials for testing only
- Never use private key on mainnet in plain text
- Change `DOWNLOAD_SECRET` before production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Gas Costs**
- Each contract deploy: ~0.01-0.02 ETH
- Each token creation: ~0.01-0.02 ETH
- Each transaction: ~0.001-0.005 ETH

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limits**
- Basescan API: 5 requests/second
- RPC node: Check provider limits
- Frontend polling: 1 second between updates
