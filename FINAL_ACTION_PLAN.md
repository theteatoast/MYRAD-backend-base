## 🚀 Next Steps - How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# Check if backend is running on port 4000
curl http://localhost:4000/

# Should respond with:
# 🚀 MYRAD Backend API running ✅
```

### Step 2: Verify Datasets are Loaded
```bash
# Check datasets endpoint
curl http://localhost:4000/datasets

# Should show the TEST token or empty {} if cleared
```

### Step 3: Manual Testing in Browser

#### Test Buy Function:
1. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
2. Click "Connect Wallet" and approve MetaMask connection
3. You should see the TEST dataset token
4. Enter `0.001` in the "ETH to spend" field
5. Click "Buy" button
6. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
7. **Expected**: Status shows "✅ Buy confirmed!" and balance updates

#### Test Sell Function:
1. After buying, you should have tokens
2. Enter `100` in the "Token amt" field  
3. Click "Sell" button
4. Confirm token approval if prompted
5. Confirm the sell transaction in MetaMask
6. **Expected**: Status shows "✅ Sell confirmed!" and ETH received

#### Test Burn Function:
1. Make sure you have some tokens left
2. Click "🔥 Burn for Download" button
3. Confirm the burn in MetaMask
4. Wait for status to update
5. **Expected**: 
   - First: "🔥 Sending burn transaction..."
   - Then: "✅ Burned! Waiting for backend access..."
   - Finally: "✅ Download opened!" (or timeout after 20s)

## 📝 What to Monitor During Testing

### Terminal 1 - Backend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Watch for:
- Dataset creation logs
- Upload confirmations
- Error messages

### Terminal 2 - Listener Service
```bash
npm run listen
```
Watch for:
- "👀 Subscribing to:" messages (contracts being watched)
- "Transfer burn detected:" messages (when tokens burned)
- "🔥 Granting access:" messages (when download granted)

### Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
Watch for:
- Any JavaScript errors
- fetch() calls to backend
- ethers contract interactions

---

## 🐛 What to Do if Something Breaks

### Issue: Buy fails with BAD_DATA error
**Status**: Should be FIXED now
- Verify you're using the new TEST token (`0xA78B71E4F785538D92f8975EE75039583FB1c31c`)
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Ensure bonding curve address is correct in datasets.json

### Issue: Price shows "error"
- Check browser console for specific error
- Verify bonding curve contract exists at the address
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Sell fails with "Insufficient allowance"
- This is normal - frontend handles it by requesting approval
- Confirm the approval transaction in MetaMask first
- The sell will proceed automatically after approval

### Issue: Burn doesn't grant download access
- Make sure `npm run listen` is running in another terminal
- Check listener logs for "Transfer burn detected" message
- Wait up to 20 seconds for backend detection
- If still fails, check that db.json is being created

## 📊 Expected Behavior Summary

### Buy Function
```
Input: 0.001 ETH
↓
Contract Call: curve.getBuyAmount(0.001 ETH)
↓
Expected Output: ~5.55e11 tokens (when starting price is 0)
↓
Result: ✅ Tokens transferred to user
```

### Sell Function
```
Input: 100 tokens
↓
Step 1: Check allowance
Step 2: Request approval if needed
Step 3: Contract Call: curve.getSellAmount(100 tokens)
↓
Expected Output: ~5.55e-8 ETH (proportional to liquidity)
↓
Result: ✅ ETH transferred to user
```

### Burn Function
```
Input: Burn button click
↓
Step 1: Send burn transaction
Step 2: Listener detects Transfer to 0x0
Step 3: Backend signs JWT download token
Step 4: Save access record in db.json
Step 5: Frontend polls /access endpoint
Step 6: Receive signed download URL
↓
Result: ✅ Download opened (or timeout after 20s)
```

## ✨ Key Improvements Since Last Session

### Critical Fixes
1. **Division by Zero in getBuyAmount()**
   - Before: Contract call failed with BAD_DATA
   - After: Returns tokens at 1:1 ratio when price is 0
   - Files: `contracts/BondingCurve.sol`

2. **Division by Zero in getSellAmount()**
   - Before: Potential crash if tokenSupply is 0
   - After: Safely returns 0
   - Files: `contracts/BondingCurve.sol`

### Code Quality
- Removed unused variables
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added contract existence validation
- Added input validation on all user inputs

### Documentation
- Created FIXES_APPLIED.md - detailed bug fix documentation
- Created TESTING_GUIDE.md - step-by-step testing instructions
- Created IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - architecture overview
- Created FINAL_ACTION_PLAN.md - this file

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system will be considered fully tested and working when:

- [ ] **Buy Test**: Can successfully buy tokens with ETH
- [ ] **Sell Test**: Can successfully sell tokens for ETH
- [ ] **Burn Test**: Can successfully burn tokens and download the file
- [ ] **No BAD_DATA Errors**: All contract calls succeed
- [ ] **Price Updates**: Price displays correctly (not "error")
- [ ] **Balance Updates**: User balance updates after buy/sell/burn
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs show appropriate error messages
