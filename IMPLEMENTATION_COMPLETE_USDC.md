## 📋 Key Differences: ETH → USDC

| Aspect | ETH Version | USDC Version |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Liquidity Asset** | ETH | USDC (stablecoin) |
| **Buy Input** | ETH amount | USDC amount |
| **Price Display** | ETH/token | USDC/token |
| **Formula** | Linear bonding curve | Constant product (k=x*y) |
| **Initial Liquidity** | 0.005 ETH | 1 USDC |
| **Fees** | None | 5% on buy (80% creator, 20% treasury) |
| **Contract** | BondingCurve | DataTokenMarketplace |

## 🚀 How the System Works

### 1. Creating a Dataset with Token

**User Steps**:
1. Upload file (CSV, PDF, JSON, etc.)
2. Fill in: Name, Symbol, Description
3. System creates token + initializes USDC pool

**What Happens**:
```
File uploaded → IPFS (Lighthouse) → CID obtained
                        ↓
Token created via DataCoinFactory
                        ↓
Tokens distributed:
  90% (900,000) → Marketplace liquidity
  5% (50,000)   → Creator wallet
  5% (50,000)   → Platform treasury
                        ↓
Pool initialized:
  900,000 tokens + 1 USDC → DataTokenMarketplace
                        ↓
Price: 1 USDC ÷ 900,000 tokens = 0.0000011 USDC/token
```

### 2. Buying Tokens with USDC

**User Steps**:
1. Enter USDC amount (e.g., 0.1)
2. Approve USDC spending
3. Click "Buy"

**What Happens**:
```
0.1 USDC sent to marketplace
                        ↓
5% fee deducted (0.005 USDC)
  → 80% to creator (0.004 USDC)
  → 20% to treasury (0.001 USDC)
                        ↓
0.095 USDC added to pool
                        ↓
Formula: tokensOut = rToken - (k / (rUSDC + 0.095))
         tokensOut ≈ 8,612 tokens
                        ↓
User receives ~8,612 tokens
Price increases slightly
```

### 3. Selling Tokens for USDC

**User Steps**:
1. Enter token amount (e.g., 100)
2. Approve token spending
3. Click "Sell"

**What Happens**:
```
100 tokens sent to marketplace
                        ↓
Formula: usdcOut = rUSDC - (k / (rToken + 100))
         usdcOut ≈ 0.00011 USDC
                        ↓
User receives ~0.00011 USDC
Price decreases slightly
```

### 4. Burning for Download Access

**User Steps**:
1. Click "🔥 Burn for Download"
2. Confirm amount in popup
3. Approve burn in MetaMask

**What Happens**:
```
Token.burn(amount) called
                        ↓
Transfer(user, 0x0, amount) emitted
                        ↓
Listener detects burn event (every 8 seconds)
                        ↓
signDownloadUrl(cid, user) creates JWT token
                        ↓
Save to db.json:
  {
    "user": "0x...",
    "symbol": "SYMBOL",
    "downloadUrl": "https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/CID?token=JWT",
    "ts": timestamp
  }
                        ↓
Frontend polls /access endpoint
                        ↓
Download URL returned
                        ↓
Frontend opens download in new tab
```

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Constant Product Formula
```
k = rToken × rUSDC (invariant - stays constant)

For buying X USDC:
  fee = X × 5%
  usdcToPool = X - fee
  newRUSDC = rUSDC + usdcToPool
  newRToken = k / newRUSDC
  tokensOut = rToken - newRToken

For selling X tokens:
  newRToken = rToken + X
  newRUSDC = k / newRToken
  usdcOut = rUSDC - newRUSDC
```

### Token Allocation (90/5/5)
```
Total supply: 1,000,000 tokens
  Marketplace: 900,000 (90%)
  Creator:      50,000 (5%)
  Treasury:     50,000 (5%)
```

### Fee Structure
```
Buy transaction: 5% of USDC input
  80% → Creator (4%)
  20% → Treasury (1%)

Sell transaction: No fees
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check if marketplace is working
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/datasets
# Should return {} or token data
```

### Check if listener is running
```bash
# Look in backend logs for:
# "Listener running (HTTP polling)"
# "Starting polling from block: XXXXX"
```

### Check if token creation worked
```bash
# Look in backend logs for:
# "✅ Pool initialized"
# "📊 Liquidity Pool State:"
```

### Check if burn was detected
```bash
# Look in backend logs for:
# "🔥 Poll-detected burn:"
# "🔥 Granting access:"

# Check db.json for entry:
cat backend/db.json
```
