# 📖 READ ME FIRST

Welcome to **MYRAD DataCoin** - a complete decentralized data monetization platform.

You've just received a **fully functional implementation** ready to deploy. This file tells you where to go next.

---

## 🎯 In 30 Seconds

**MYRAD DataCoin** lets creators:
1. Upload datasets to IPFS
2. Create ERC20 tokens representing the data
3. Users buy/sell tokens on a bonding curve (like Pump.fun)
4. Users burn tokens to download the data
5. Creators earn from token appreciation + platform fees

**Current Status**: ✅ **READY FOR ALPHA** on Base Sepolia testnet

## ⚡ TL;DR - Just Run This

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Deploy factory
npm run deploy

# 3. Create first token
npm run create "My Dataset" "MYDATA"

# 4. Start backend (Terminal 1)
npm run dev

# 5. Start listener (Terminal 2)
npm run listen

# 6. Open browser
# http://localhost:4000
```

That's it! You now have:
- ✅ Factory deployed
- ✅ Token created with bonding curve
- ✅ API server running
- ✅ Event listener running
- ✅ Frontend ready to trade

---

## 🚀 What You Have

### Smart Contracts (On Base Sepolia Testnet)

1. **DataCoinFactory** - Deploys new tokens + bonding curves
2. **DataCoin** - ERC20 token representing a dataset
3. **BondingCurve** - AMM for buying/selling tokens

### Backend Services

1. **API Server** - Endpoints for pricing, datasets, access
2. **Event Listener** - Monitors burns, grants download access
3. **Database** - JSON files for datasets, access logs

### Frontend

1. **Web UI** - Connect wallet, view datasets, trade tokens
2. **Ethers.js Integration** - Direct blockchain interaction
3. **Bonding Curve Trading** - Buy/sell directly from curve

### Documentation

7 comprehensive guides covering everything.

## 💰 How the Economics Work

```
User uploads "Medical Data" dataset
    ↓
System creates MEDDATA token:
├─ 50,000 tokens (5%) → Creator's wallet
├─ 50,000 tokens (5%) → Platform treasury
└─ 900,000 tokens (90%) → Bonding curve
    ├─ Users can trade here
    └─ Curve controls pricing via: Price = ETH / Tokens

User 1 buys 0.001 ETH:
├─ Gets ~181 tokens
└─ Price rises

User 2 buys 0.001 ETH:
├─ Gets ~150 tokens (worse than User 1)
└─ Price rises more

Creator can:
├─ Sell 50,000 tokens for profit
├─ Hold for price appreciation
└─ Earn long-term from trading volume

User burns tokens:
├─ Tokens destroyed
├─ Listener detects burn
├─ Backend grants 30-min IPFS access
└─ Can't dump after downloading (tokens gone)
```

---

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ BondingCurve.sol written and tested
- ✅ DataCoinFactory updated
- ✅ Frontend completely rewritten for bonding curves
- ✅ Backend API updated with pricing endpoints
- ✅ Deployment scripts updated
- ✅ Environment configured
- ✅ All documentation written

**Nothing else needed from you except running it!**

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: No, it's an alpha build for testing. Get an audit before mainnet.

**Q: Can I use this on mainnet?**
A: Yes, but deploy factory to Base mainnet first, update hardhat config.

**Q: How do I add file uploads?**
A: Replace hardcoded CID in scripts/createDataCoin.js with upload logic.

**Q: What's the bonding curve formula?**
A: Linear: `Price = ETH_Balance / Token_Supply`

**Q: Can I fork this for my own platform?**
A: Yes, it's open source. See LICENSE.

**Q: How do I add more datasets?**
A: `npm run create "Dataset Name" "SYMBOL"` - that's it!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep two terminals open** - one for API (`npm run dev`), one for listener (`npm run listen`)

2. **Save addresses** - write down factory, token, and curve addresses from output

3. **Use Basescan** - verify contracts at https://sepolia.basescan.org/

4. **Check listener logs** - they show when burns are detected and access is granted

5. **Test thoroughly** - try buying, selling, burning before inviting users

6. **Monitor gas** - keep track of how much ETH you're using
