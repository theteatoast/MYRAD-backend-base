## 💰 Token Economics

### When You Create a Dataset Token

```
1,000,000 tokens total

├─ 900,000 to Bonding Curve (90%)
│  └─ Users buy/sell here
│  └─ Price = ETH / Tokens
│
├─ 50,000 to Creator (5%)
│  └─ Your wallet
│
└─ 50,000 to Platform (5%)
   └─ Your treasury wallet (0x342F...)

Plus: 0.005 ETH (~$5) initial liquidity
```

```

### Pricing
```
GET /price/:curveAddress
→ Returns: {price, ethBalance, tokenSupply}

GET /quote/buy/:curveAddress/:ethAmount
→ Returns: {ethAmount, tokenAmount}

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Never share private key** - It's testnet only but still secure it
2. **Change DOWNLOAD_SECRET** - Use a strong random string in production
3. **Use HTTPS** - Before mainnet, use HTTPS for all connections
4. **Get security audit** - Before mainnet, hire professional auditors
5. **Test thoroughly** - Test every feature thoroughly before alpha

## 🚀 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run deploy           # Deploy factory
npm run create "N" "S"   # Create token
npm run dev              # Start API (Terminal 1)
npm run listen           # Start listener (Terminal 2)
npm run server           # Alias for dev
```

## 🎓 How It All Works (Simple Explanation)

### User Creates Dataset
```
User uploads "Medical Data"
    ↓
Creates "MEDDATA" token
    ↓
System mints tokens:
  - 900k to bonding curve
  - 50k to creator
  - 50k to platform
    ↓
System sends 0.005 ETH to curve
```

### Users Trade
```
User buys 0.001 ETH
    ↓
Gets tokens from bonding curve
    ↓
Price increases
    ↓
User can sell anytime
    ↓
Price adjusts
```

### Users Access Data
```
User has tokens
    ↓
Clicks "Burn for Download"
    ↓
Tokens burned
    ↓
Listener detects burn
    ↓
Backend grants 30-min access
    ↓
User downloads from IPFS
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Makes This Different
1. **Custom AMM** - Not dependent on Uniswap
2. **Correct Economics** - 90/5/5 split (not 80/15/5)
3. **Direct Trading** - Contract-based, not pool-based
4. **Access Control** - Burn tokens for data access
5. **Complete Stack** - Everything included

### Why This Matters
- **No Uniswap dependency** - Works anywhere
- **Fair allocation** - Creator and platform get fair share
- **Sustainable model** - Users can't dump after downloading
- **Self-contained** - Everything in one codebase
- **Production-ready** - Can deploy to mainnet
