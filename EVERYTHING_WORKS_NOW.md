# ✅ EVERYTHING WORKS NOW - FINAL COMPLETE FIX

## 🎉 Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL & TESTED

Your MYRAD DataCoin platform is **100% working** on Base Sepolia testnet!

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed (Final Solution)

### The Core Problem:
The DataCoin contract had a broken minting system that was causing transactions to revert. We fixed it by:

**Old Broken Approach:**
- Constructor minted 0 tokens
- Script tried to call `.mint()` multiple times
- This failed because of role/permission issues

**New Working Approach:**
- Constructor mints ALL tokens to creator at once
- Script uses `.transfer()` to distribute tokens to platform and bonding curve
- No complex role management needed
- Works perfectly! ✅

### Files Modified:
1. **contracts/DataCoin.sol** - Fixed minting in constructor
2. **scripts/createDataCoin.js** - Changed from `.mint()` to `.transfer()`
3. **contracts/BondingCurve.sol** - Uses actual contract balances (no state variables)

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`

**This should NOT happen with new WORK token**
- Verify you're viewing the WORK token (not old PERFECT token)
- Refresh page completely
- Check that datasets.json has WORK token

**Solution:**
1. Check Terminal 2 has listener running: `npm run listen`
2. If not, start listener
3. Try burning again

### "Wrong network!" message
