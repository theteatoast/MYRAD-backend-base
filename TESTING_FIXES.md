# 🔧 Testing Fixes Applied

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. ✅ BondingCurve.sol - Fixed DIVIDE_BY_ZERO Error
**Problem**: `getBuyAmount` was calculating `(ethAmount * tokenBal) / ethBal` even when `ethBal` could be 0, causing division by zero panic.

**Fix**: 
- Now returns `0` immediately if either `tokenBal` or `ethBal` is 0
- This prevents the division from happening when curve is empty
- Proper error handling in frontend shows "Insufficient liquidity" instead of contract panic

**Changed in**: `contracts/BondingCurve.sol` lines 30-45

---

### 2. ✅ createDatasetAPI.js - Improved ETH Transfer Validation
**Problem**: ETH transfer to bonding curve wasn't being validated, could fail silently.

**Fix**:
- Now checks receipt after ETH transfer
- Throws error if transfer fails
- Logs transaction hash for verification

**Changed in**: `backend/createDatasetAPI.js` lines 132-147

---

### 3. ✅ listener.js - Fixed Burn Event Detection
**Problem**: Address comparison `to === ethers.ZeroAddress` wasn't working correctly due to checksum address format.

**Fix**:
- Convert both addresses to lowercase before comparison
- Added better logging for burn detection
- Fixed in both WebSocket and HTTP polling sections

**Changed in**: `backend/listener.js` lines 78-87, 113-123, 201-208

## How to Test

### Step 1: Upload a Dataset File
1. Open the app and connect wallet (Base Sepolia testnet)
2. Click "Upload Dataset"
3. Select any file (CSV, PDF, JSON, etc.)
4. Fill in details:
   - **Name**: e.g., "MyData"
   - **Symbol**: e.g., "DATA" (1-10 uppercase letters)
   - **Description**: Any description
5. Click "Create Token"
6. Wait for confirmation (should take ~30-60 seconds)

### Step 2: Verify Token Creation
After creation, you should see:
- ✅ Token deployed successfully
- ✅ Bonding curve created
- ✅ Token allocation: 90% to curve, 5% to creator, 5% to platform
- ✅ Initial liquidity: 0.005 ETH sent to curve

**Expected Output**:
```
📊 Bonding Curve State:
   ETH: 0.005 ETH
   Tokens: 900000
   Price: 0.000000000000000005 ETH/token (approximately)
```

### Step 3: Test BUY Operation
1. Look at your new dataset in the list
2. You should see: **Price: X ETH/token** (NOT 0.0 ETH)
3. Enter ETH amount to spend (e.g., 0.001)
4. Click "Buy"
5. Confirm in wallet
6. Should receive tokens without DIVIDE_BY_ZERO error

**Expected Result**: ✅ "Buy confirmed! Received ~X tokens"

### Step 4: Test SELL Operation
1. After buying, you should have tokens
2. Enter token amount to sell (e.g., 100)
3. Click "Sell"
4. Approve tokens if prompted
5. Confirm in wallet
6. Should receive ETH back

**Expected Result**: ✅ "Sell confirmed! Received ~X ETH"

### Step 5: Test BURN for Download
1. Click "🔥 Burn for Download"
2. Confirm amount to burn in wallet popup
3. Wait for transaction confirmation
4. The app will poll backend for download access
5. After 2-3 seconds, should show download link

**Expected Result**: ✅ Download link opens OR "✅ Download opened!"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Price: 0.0 ETH"
- **Cause**: Curve has no ETH or tokens
- **Fix**: Re-create the dataset - ensure step 3 completes with ETH transfer

### Issue: "❌ Insufficient liquidity" on Buy
- **Cause**: Bonding curve is empty
- **Fix**: Create new token, verify ETH is sent successfully

### Issue: "❌ Insufficient liquidity or invalid amount" on Sell
- **Cause**: Either you don't own tokens, or curve is empty
- **Fix**: Buy tokens first, then try selling

### Issue: "⚠️ Burn confirmed but download not ready"
- **Cause**: Listener isn't detecting burn event or db.json isn't being updated
- **Debug Steps**:
  1. Check backend logs for: `🔥 Poll-detected burn:` or `🔥 Transfer burn detected`
  2. If logs show burn detected, check `backend/db.json` - should have an entry
  3. If db.json is updated but download not ready, try again in 5 seconds (access might be cached)

### Issue: "❌ Contract error: execution reverted: Panic due to DIVIDE_BY_ZERO(18)"
- **Cause**: This should NOT happen with the new code
- **Fix**: 
  1. Ensure contracts are recompiled: `npx hardhat compile`
  2. Artifacts are updated
  3. Create fresh token

## Key Changes Summary

| File | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `contracts/BondingCurve.sol` | Returns 0 instead of dividing when ethBal=0 | Prevents DIVIDE_BY_ZERO panic |
| `backend/createDatasetAPI.js` | Validates ETH transfer receipt | Ensures liquidity is actually sent |
| `backend/listener.js` | Lowercase address comparison | Correctly detects burns to 0x0 |

## Technical Details

### BondingCurve Formula
```
For buying: tokens = (ethAmount * tokenBalance) / ethBalance
For selling: eth = (tokenAmount * ethBalance) / tokenBalance
With 10% slippage applied to both
```

### Initialization (90/5/5 Split)
- 90% of tokens → Bonding Curve (liquidity)
- 5% of tokens → Creator
- 5% of tokens → Platform (MYRAD_TREASURY)
- 0.005 ETH → Bonding Curve (initial liquidity)

### Burn Flow
1. User calls `burn()` on DataCoin contract
2. Emits `Transfer(user, 0x0, amount)` event
3. Listener detects burn to address(0)
4. `handleRedeemOrBurn` called
5. Download URL signed and saved to `db.json`
6. Frontend polls `/access/{user}/{symbol}` endpoint
7. Backend returns download URL from db.json
8. Frontend opens download link
