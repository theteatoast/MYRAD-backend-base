- Base Sepolia testnet ETH from https://www.basefaucet.io/

### 5-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Deploy factory contract
npm run deploy
# ✅ Save the factory address!

# 3. Create first dataset token
npm run create "Medical Data" "MEDDATA"

# 4. Start backend (Terminal 1)
npm run dev
# Output: 🚀 Backend API running on port 4000

# 5. Start listener (Terminal 2, NEW TERMINAL)
npm run listen
# Output: Listener running (HTTP polling)

# 6. Open in browser
# http://localhost:4000
```

That's it! 🎉

## 🎯 What You Have Now

### ✅ Smart Contracts
- **DataCoinFactory**: Creates new dataset tokens + bonding curves
- **DataCoin**: ERC20 token representing a dataset
- **BondingCurve**: AMM for buy/sell (like Pump.fun)

### ✅ Backend Services
- **API Server**: Endpoints for datasets, pricing, quotes
- **Event Listener**: Monitors burns, grants download access
- **IPFS Gateway**: Lighthouse integration for file access

### ✅ Frontend
- **React-like UI**: Connect wallet, view datasets
- **Trading Interface**: Buy/sell tokens with bonding curve
- **Access Control**: Burn tokens for dataset downloads

### ✅ Token Economics
- **Creator**: Gets 5% of new tokens
- **Platform**: Gets 5% of new tokens
- **Liquidity**: 90% in bonding curve for trading
- **Initial Liquidity**: ~$5 per dataset

## 📊 How It Works

```
1. CREATE DATASET
   User uploads data (hardcoded CID for now)
   ↓
   Name token: "Medical Data" (MEDDATA)
   ↓
   System creates token + bonding curve
   ↓
   Mints: 90% liquidity, 5% creator, 5% platform

2. USERS BUY TOKENS
   User pays ETH via bonding curve
   ↓
   Price rises with each buy
   ↓
   Early buyers get best prices
   ↓
   Creator can hold or sell for profit

3. USERS SELL TOKENS
   User sends tokens back to curve
   ↓
   Gets ETH based on current price
   ↓
   Price drops with each sell
   ↓
   Incentivizes holding

4. ACCESS DATASET
   User burns tokens
   ↓
   Listener detects burn event
   ↓
   Backend generates signed download link
   ↓
   User gets 30-minute access to IPFS file
   ↓
   Can't sell after downloading (tokens burned)
```

## 💰 Token Economics Example

When you create "Medical Data" (MEDDATA):

```
Initial State:
├─ Creator: 50,000 MEDDATA (5%)
├─ Platform: 50,000 MEDDATA (5%)
└─ Bonding Curve: 900,000 MEDDATA (90%)
   ├─ ETH Balance: 0.005 (~$5)
   └─ Price: 0.0000055 ETH per token

User 1 buys 0.001 ETH:
├─ Price rises to: 0.000006 ETH
├─ Gets ~181 tokens
└─ ETH Balance: 0.006

User 2 buys 0.001 ETH:
├─ Price rises to: 0.00000666 ETH
├─ Gets ~150 tokens
└─ ETH Balance: 0.007

User 1 sells 100 tokens:
├─ Gets 0.0007 ETH (less than paid for 100)
├─ Price drops slightly
└─ But early buyers still profitable
```

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

1. **Burn for Access**: Users burn tokens to gain dataset access
   - Can't dump after downloading (tokens gone)
   - Creates real demand for tokens
   - Incentivizes holding

2. **JWT Signing**: Download links are time-limited
   - 30-minute expiry
   - Can't share permanently
   - Re-burn for new access

3. **Bonding Curve**: No liquidity pool hacks
   - Contract directly manages curve
   - No middleman
   - All ETH stays in curve

## 🚨 Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "FACTORY_ADDRESS not set" | Deploy factory first, save address |
| No testnet ETH | Get from https://www.basefaucet.io/ |
| Can't connect wallet | Install MetaMask, add Base Sepolia |
| API not responding | Make sure `npm run dev` running |
| Listener not working | Make sure `npm run listen` running |
| Buy/sell errors | Check you have ETH, correct network |
